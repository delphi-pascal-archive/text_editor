1.  Installing the game using "Autorun"

a) Installing FIFA 2002
The easiest method of installing FIFA 2002 is to use the "Autorun" feature.  Upon inserting the FIFA 2002 CD into your CD-ROM drive, and selecting the language in which you wish to install, the game will bring you to the FIFA 2002 "Autorun" Screen. From here, select "Install" to launch the FIFA 2002 InstallShield Wizard.

b) Minimum Hard drive space required
It is important to note that you must have a minimum of 80 MB hard drive space free to run the game. This includes space for the game installation, swap file, and DirectX 7.0.716 installation.

c) If your "Autorun" feature is disabled
If for some reason your "Autorun" feature is disabled, you can install the program by running AUTORUN.EXE directly from the root directory of the CD.

Note: Manually performing a second FIFA 2002 install (by running SETUP.EXE in the "\Setup" directory on the CD) before uninstalling the original game files is not recommended. More specifically, installing into the same location twice can cause the game to malfunction. To avoid problems, the "Autorun" feature should be used for all installs and uninstalls.



2. New options on "Autorun" screen after install

After you've successfully installed the game, you may notice that the "Install" button is no longer visible on the "Autorun" screen. In addition, several new buttons will appear, namely:

"Play" - launches FIFA 2002.
"Uninstall" - See section 4 for details on uninstalling the game.
"Register" - if you did not register your copy of the game during the install process, you can do so by selecting this button.



3.  DirectX

If you try to run the game without DirectX installed, the program will crash. For FIFA 2002, the minimum supported version of DirectX is DirectX 7.0a. For your convenience, we have included DirectX 7.0.716 on the FIFA 2002 CD. 

a.) Installing DirectX directly from CD (if you skipped it during game install)
FIFA 2002 comes with DirectX 8.1.3 and will prompt you to install it during the installation process.  If you would like to install it manually, make sure the FIFA 2002 CD is in the CD-ROM drive, and access the following path on your CD-ROM drive:  

"\DirectX\DXSETUP.EXE"

 Double-click on DXSETUP.EXE to begin DirectX 8.1.3 installation.

b.) DirectX and supported hardware
We recommend that FIFA 2002 be run with DirectX compatible sound cards and video cards. While there is a good chance that FIFA 2002 will run with non-DirectX compatible hardware, you may find that:

          	i)  Sound quality suffers
           	ii) The game runs slightly slower.
	iii) The game does not run at all.

If your sound card or video card does not support DirectX, please contact your vendor.



4. Uninstalling FIFA 2002

The simplest method of uninstalling FIFA 2002 is to use the "Uninstall" button on the FIFA 2002 "Autorun" screen. You may also use the Uninstall shortcut in the Start Menu, which can be found at the same location as the shortcut used to launch the game (usually "Start Menu/Programs/EA Sports/FIFA 2002")

Windows also has an "Add/Remove Programs" Icon in the Control Panel that you can use to uninstall the game.



5. Memory requirements

a.) Memory requirements in Windows 
FIFA 2002 requires a minimum of 32 MB of RAM to run. If there is more memory available, you should experience better game performance in all areas.

b.) Running the game under stressful Windows conditions
At Electronic Arts we strive to bring you the best in graphics, audio and gameplay.  We are always pushing the envelope of computer performance. While we have made every effort to ensure that FIFA 2002 multi-tasks with all Windows applications, we recommend that you shut down other applications (including virus scanners) and run FIFA 2002 by itself when possible.



6. Improving game speed (frame-rates, etc.) 

There are several ways by which you can speed up the overall FIFA 2002 experience: 

a.) choose a larger install - the more data that is on your hard drive, the less time your PC needs to spend accessing the CD.
b.) adjust the Render Options on the Options screen - these options allow the user to reduce graphical quality to achieve better performance.
c.) disable the radar on the Options screen.
d.) select the "on the pitch" sound effects mix on the Options screen.



7. Hot Keys

The following hot keys can be used to access certain functions more quickly:

In the Front End (before you get to the game)
F10 - Chat (Multiplayer only)
F11 - Quit/Disconnect (Multiplayer only)
F12 - Exit to Windows

In the game
ESC - Pause Menu
F1 - Tele Cam
F2 - Tower Cam
F3 - End to End Cam
F4 - Action Cam
F5 - Team Management
F6 - Instant Replay
F7 - Match Facts
F8 - Options
F9 - Side Select
F10 - Chat (Multiplayer only)
F11 - Quit/Disconnect (Multiplayer only)
F12 - Exit to Windows



8. Keyboard, joystick and mouse functionality

You must use the mouse to navigate the game interface. Click on buttons and icons to select modes and options. The keyboard is available to enter information or send chat messages when playing other users via modem or network. 

Joysticks/gamepads will not operate until you are in a game, except on the side select screen. When you are on this screen, you must move whichever input device you plan to use in the game to the left or the right to select your team. The game will automatically detect the type of device it is and a graphic will display depicting it. 

Please note that you may have to recalibrate your controllers with each new install in order to have the game detect them correctly.

Some buttons may be reversed on a few USB plug and play gamepads. If the gamepad manufacturer has provided software with the device, installing it may correct the problem.

We highly recommend the use of a Gravis Gamepad Pro, Logitech Wingman-Series Gamepad, or Microsoft Sidewinder for in-game play.  

To bring up the in-game pause menus, you can press the Start button (if your gamepad has one) or press ESC and then navigate with the mouse again.

ALT-TAB is not supported in FIFA 2002.

Refer to the "Control Summary" card included in the FIFA 2002 jewel case for more detailed information on the in-game play controls.



9.  Modem 

a) Dial and Wait for call
ESC can always abort the connection attempt.  The game will also time-out after 5 minutes.

b) Call Waiting
We recommend that call waiting be disabled, as we have experienced some problems with it during modem games. Specifically, call waiting can disrupt modem games already in progress.



10. Notes on Internet Matchmaker

You must have Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0, Netscape 6.0, Compuserve 2000 or AOL 4.0 (or higher) installed for Internet Matchmaker to launch correctly. 
You can download updated browsers from:
Netscape:  http://www.netscape.com/download/index.html?cp=djuc1
Explorer: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm



11. AOL IP Information

On an AOL dial-up connection the IP information provided on the Direct IP screen is the "AOL Dial up Adapter" and may or may not be the correct IP address of your machine. To get the correct IP address you must return to Windows. From the START menu click RUN. Type in  'winipcfg' and get the IP information for the "AOL Adapter", NOT the "AOL Dial-Up Adapter". Use the "AOL adapter" IP information as your IP address.



12. Notes on video card chipsets

If you are experiencing problems with your video card and FIFA 2002, try updating your video card driver by downloading the latest driver available from the video card manufacturer. If there is no improvement, try using the latest driver provided by the video chipset manufacturer. Your video card chipset is the video processing chip located on your video card. If there is no information in your video card manual or website, check the video card for an identifying chip with the chipset manufacturer's name on it. Some popular video chipset manufacturer's websites are listed below: 

3Dfx		http://www.3dfx.com/
NVidia		http://www.nvidia.com/
3DLabs		http://www.3dlabs.com/
Matrox		http://www.matrox.com/
Intel		http://www.intel.com/
Rendition		http://www.rendition.com/
ATI		http://www.ati.com/



13. Notes on 3Dfx

Chipsets tested & supported:
Voodoo 4
Voodoo 5

Recommended chipsets:
Voodoo 4 [supported via Glide (default)]
Voodoo 5 [supported via D3D (default)]

If you experience graphical corruption in-game with a card that has the Voodoo 2 chipset, you may have an incorrect driver for Glide 3.  

If you experience problems, please contact your card manufacturer or chipset vendor to get the latest drivers.

If you experience palette corruption in the loading screen or in-game and have the MS Office Toolbar loaded, try running the game without the toolbar.



14. Notes on D3D Support

Chipsets tested and supported:
ATI Radeon
NVidia GeForce 2
NVidia GeForce 3
NVidia Quadro
NVidia Riva 128
NVidia RIVA TNT2 (Ultra) 
Matrox G400
Matrox G800
3Dlabs Permedia 2
3Dlabs Permedia 3
Rendition Verite V2100/2200

KYRO PowerVR 3

Recommended chipsets:
ATI Rage 128
ATI Radeon
NVidia GeForce 3
NVidia GeForce 4
NVidia Quadro
NVidia RIVA TNT
NVidia RIVA TNT2 (Ultra)
Matrox G800

The 3D Setup program (located in "Start Menu/Programs/EA Sports/FIFA 2002") defaults to D3D support for the above chipsets. 

If your card has D3D support and is not one of the chipsets above, the 3D Setup program will default to Software Rendering. In some cases, this may run faster. However, if your D3D card has 4MB of texture memory (or AGP texturing), you can choose D3D support in 3D Setup. Please note that other cards have not been tested and may not work with FIFA 2002. 

If you experience problems, please contact your card manufacturer or chipset vendor to get the latest drivers.

The recommended drivers for the NVidia Riva128 chipset are the latest reference drivers found on www.nvidia.com. We recommend Version 4.11.01.0341.

The Recommended drivers for the TNT and TNT2/TNT2Ultra cards are the Detonator drivers found on www.nvidia.com. Recommended versions are 3 (D3) or higher.



15. Notes on Sound and Video Cards

FIFA2002 defaults to a 1024x768 screen resolution. The 3D Setup utility available from the start menu will allow you to select higher resolutions on supported cards. Due to differing VRAM configurations, your card may not support the highest listed resolutions. If FIFA2001 cannot run in the resolution selected, it will run in the default 1024x768 mode instead.

FIFA 2002 is compatible with most standard video and sound cards.  Listed below are some troubleshooting hints for a few cards that may present some problems.

a) Problems with NVidia-based video cards
NVidia-based video cards with older drivers may display a white screen when entering the game. If this occurs, we recommend downloading and installing the Detonator 3 (D3) reference drivers on www.nvidia.com to solve the problem.

For best look and performance, the following should be set via the NVidia RIVA 128 video card control panel:
Per pixel mipmapping: Disabled; 
Automatically generate 8 mipmap levels; 
Direct3D Texture Memory Size: 5-10 MB

On the TNT and TNT2 class cards if you are having trouble with unreadable or scrambled fonts, try changing the Addressing Mode switches in the TNT/TNT2 video card control panel to:
Non-Filtered Texel Origin: Upper left corner; 
Filtered Texel Origin: x=0.00 texels, y=0.00 texels.
You may need to adjust these settings slightly, depending on your individual set-up.

b.) Problems with NVidia GeForce256 and NVidia Quadro cards
There is a known crash issue with Detonator2 Geforce/Quadro video drivers prior to the 5.x series from NVidia. The latest Detonator 3 (6.x) series of NVidia drivers fix this problem.  
 
Please contact NVidia (http://www.nvidia.com) or your board vendor for more information and release dates for future drivers based on the NVidia Detonator 3 series.

The latest NVidia drivers can be found here: http://www.nvidia.com/Products.nsf/htmlmedia/software_drivers.html

c) Problems with VIA motherboard chipsets
There are known problems with VIA motherboard chipsets used with an AGP video card and a PCI sound card, including crackling audio and possible lockups of the machine. These problems do not occur if both the video and the sound card are PCI-based.

d.) Problems with Windows 98/98SE Intel Camino and Athlon motherboards
For users with Windows 98/98SE Intel Camino and Athlon motherboards, a patch may be needed to enable proper AGP support. Users who are experiencing performance issues with the NVIDIA 3.x driver series and NVIDIA GeForce and Quadro cards should install this patch. Other users experiencing performance issues may also want to install the patch.

For Intel motherboards (i810, i810E, i820, i840, i430, i440):
http://developer.intel.com/design/software/drivers/platform/inf/infinst_enu_pv22.htm

For Athlon motherboards with the AMD-751 System Controller (Northbridge):
http://www.amd.com/products/cpg/bin/miniport_461.exe

For Athlon motherboards that do not use the AMD-751 System Controller please contact your motherboard maker for the correct AGP miniport driver.

e.) Problems with Software Mode
If you experience difficulties running FIFA 2002 in software mode at the default 640x400 screen resolution, run 3Dsetup, select 640x480 screen resolution, and try re-running the game.

If your monitor is detected as "Unknown Monitor" in Display Properties, this can also cause the game to malfunction in software mode. To fix the problem, select "Settings", then "Control Panel" from the Start Menu. Then, select "Display". Click on the "Settings" tab, and then the "Advanced" button.  From here, select the "Monitor" tab. Now, select "Standard Monitor Types" from the "Manufacturers" column on the left, and select "Plug and Play Monitor" from the "Models" column on the right. Click the "Next" button to continue, and reboot your machine. The game should now run correctly.



16. Notes on processors

Some non-Intel processors may not run equivalent to the processor rating of Intel processors.  For example, a non-Intel 166MHz processor may only run at the equivalent of an Intel 100MHz processor, and therefore may cause the game to run slower.

Users with P166-P200's may also experience a black screen transition delay before gameplay while the game is changing resolutions.



17. Notes on Windows 2000/Windows ME

FIFA 2002 will run under Windows 2000 & Windows ME, although these operating systems are not officially supported. However, to install the game properly, you will need administrator access to your machine. Consult your Windows 2000 documentation for more information.

Known problems with Windows 2000:
	
a.) FIFA 2002 will not run in software mode under Windows 2000. You must run the game in hardware mode (with a D3D or Glide video card) in order for the game to run correctly.

b.) The version of DirectX that is included on the FIFA 2002 CD (DirectX 8.1.3) can cause the multiplayer portion of the game to malfunction. Therefore, we recommend that you do not manually install these DirectX files. The DirectX files that are included with Windows 2000 are sufficient for running FIFA 2002.

c.) During testing, some video cards experienced problems due to driver incompatibility issues. Check your 3D card manufacturer's web site to obtain updated Windows 2000 drivers.



18. Data verification date

The player and team data used in FIFA 2002 was verified for accuracy as of August 15th, 2000. Any transfers or roster changes that occurred after this date may not be reflected in the game.
